# Shop-Shop App

The Shop Shop app is an exercise to show how to handle e-commerce in a MERN app.

With this application, you can browse a number of fake goods and see the prices for them.


You can filter results to find things easier.

You will be able to add items to your cart at any time.

Clicking on the item title or image will show a detail view

To check out, sign up or sign in.

Not to worry, the checkout is a test account, so not actual transactions will be made
(still, you might not want to use real credentials)

After each checkout, you should be able to see your order history.

This is a PWA, and will allow you to manage some things, such as searching for goods and adding them to your cart
without a consistent internet connection. You will need to have one when you're ready to checkout, however.

## Additional info for nerds

This app utilizes mongo for data persistence, node and express for the backend/service layer, react for the front-end,
it utilizes graphql for querying and service logic and it uses redux for state management.
